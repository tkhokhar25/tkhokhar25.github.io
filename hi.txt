Cristiano Ronaldo said it hurt him to see Lionel Messi in tears after Argentina’s defeat in the Copa America final and he hoped that he would reconsider his decision to retire from international football.
According to Spain’s Mundo Deportivo and AS newspapers, Ronaldo was quoted as saying, “He (Messi) has made a tough decision and people should understand. He is not accustomed to defeats and disappointments. Finishing second and missing a penalty does not make you a bad player.
